# SPACE DEFENDERS
## 06. Round System
**Version 0.5 | Prototype Phase**

---

## 6.1 Spawning Rules & Composition

Space Defenders is balanced over a fixed **10-Round Campaign**. 

- **Spawning Pacing Rule**: Within any individual round group, asteroids spawn with a **"small clusters first, big finishers last"** structure. This forces the players to deal with swift, splitting groups before handling heavy, slow-moving boss-level threats.
- **Dynamic Speed Scales**: Asteroids spawn at rates determined by the active round settings.
- **Active State Lock**: Spawning is locked to the round's preset speed. The HUD's "Launch Round" button remains disabled until every single asteroid and splitting fragment has been fully neutralized or leaked.

### Stage Breakdown

#### 1. Rounds 1–3: The Starting Squeeze
- **Financial Status**: Extremely tight. Reliance on starting **50 minerals**.
- **Tactical Strategy**: Place basic Scout ships (20 minerals each) near the entry points. Keep a small mineral buffer for early splitting response.

#### 2. Rounds 4–6: The Fleet Expands
- **Financial Status**: Moderate. Mineral availability scales to **40–56 minerals** per round.
- **Tactical Strategy**: Deploy Laser Frigates (35 minerals) and Missile Cruisers (45 minerals) to manage the boulder clusters. Purchase early **Hot/Cold Laser upgrades** on active Scouts to prepare for elemental threats.

#### 3. Rounds 7–10: High Orbit Defenses
- **Financial Status**: Flush. Heavy earnings of **60–96 minerals** per round.
- **Tactical Strategy**: Deploy the ultimate single-target **Ion Cannons** (60 minerals) to break Giants. Build **Gravity Wells** (80 minerals) at the central choke loop. Purchase **Optical Targeting** upgrades on Scouts to counter Blinding Tails.

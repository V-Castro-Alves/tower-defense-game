This document details the incoming threats, including the physics-based size-splitting system, variant behaviors, and thermal elemental reactions.

## 3.1 Asteroid Splitting System

Asteroids do not use traditional visual health bars. Instead, **their physical size represents their health**. When an asteroid's structural integrity (represented by Hits to Split) is depleted to 0, it fragments into smaller chunks.

- A **Pebble (Tier 1)** is fully destroyed and cleared from the board on taking its final hit.
- **Tiers 2 through 5** split into **two separate asteroids of the tier immediately below** when their HP is reduced to 0.

### Splitting and HP Balance Table

| Tier | Name | Hits to Split (HP) | Splits Into | Speed (px/s) | Lives Lost if Leaked | Split Mineral Reward |
|------|------|--------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **5** | Planet Chunk | 5 | 2x Giant | 40 | 12 | 16 💎 |
| **4** | Giant | 4 | 2x Meteor | 55 | 8 | 8 💎 |
| **3** | Meteor | 3 | 2x Boulder | 80 | 4 | 4 💎 |
| **2** | Boulder | 2 | 2x Pebble | 110 | 2 | 2 💎 |
| **1** | Pebble | 1 | Destroyed | 140 | 1 | 1 💎 (on death)      |

### Total Hits to Fully Clear a Spawning Chain
Due to cascading splits, a single high-tier asteroid requires numerous cumulative shots to completely clear:
- **Pebble**: 1 hit
- **Boulder**: 2 (base) + 2(1) = **4 hits** to fully destroy
- **Meteor**: 3 (base) + 2(4) = **11 hits** to fully destroy
- **Giant**: 4 (base) + 2(11) = **26 hits** to fully destroy
- **Planet Chunk**: 5 (base) + 2(26) = **57 hits** to fully destroy

*Note: The split entities spawn at the exact position of the parent's destruction and inherit the standard speed for their new tier, immediately continuing along the path. Immediate split mineral rewards are granted upon fragmentation to ensure a constant stream of player capital.*

## 3.2 Asteroid Variants

Variants are modifiers stacked on top of an asteroid's base tier (e.g., a Meteor can be a normal Meteor or a Magnetic Meteor). Variants introduce specific resistances that counter certain ship types, forcing the player to deploy a diversified fleet rather than spamming a single high-tier ship.

*Neutral asteroids dominate early rounds. Variants begin appearing in Round 5 and scale in frequency through Round 10.*

### Variant Profiles

#### ☄️ Blinding Tail
Streaks a bright, comet-like tail. 
- **Effect**: Standard visual-seeking ships (**Scout, Missile Cruiser, Drone Carrier**) are blinded when this asteroid is within **3 tiles** of them. Blinded ships cease targeting the asteroid completely.
- **Counter**: The **Optical Targeting** upgrade (available on Scouts) restores vision. **Laser Frigates** and **Ion Cannons** utilize optical spectrum/radiation tracking and are unaffected by default.
- **Appears on**: Meteor tier and above.

#### 🪨 Hard Crust
A high-density metamorphic space rock.
- **Effect**: Absorbs all weak shots entirely, taking **0 damage**. Weak shots include those from Scouts, Missile Cruiser splash damage, and Drone Carrier drones.
- **Counter**: **Ion Cannon** (heavy shots), **Laser Frigate** (pierce shots, 2+ tiers), and **Pulse Beam** (kinetic blast).
- **Appears on**: Boulder tier and above.

#### 🧲 Magnetic Core
Generates a powerful, localized magnetic shield.
- **Effect**: Regenerates HP at a rate of **0.5 hits/second**. A single Scout firing at 1.0 shot/s will barely progress past regeneration. If left undamaged for **4.0 seconds**, it fully heals back to its max HP tier.
- **Counter**: Focus-firing multiple ships, high-damage burst (**Ion Cannon**), pierce shots (**Laser Frigate**), or **Pulse Beam** kinetic hits (which disable regeneration for 2.0s).
- **Appears on**: Meteor tier and above.

#### 🪐 Ring Belt
Surrounded by an orbital belt of orbiting sand, gravel, and ice debris.
- **Effect**: Deflects all area-of-effect and splash damage. **Missile Cruiser** splash and **Drone Carrier** drone strikes deal 0 damage.
- **Counter**: Straight-line pierce shots that pass through the belt (**Laser Frigate**), high-speed heavy projectiles (**Ion Cannon**), and point-blank focused direct fire (**Scout**).
- **Appears on**: Giant tier and above.

## 3.3 Elemental Asteroid Sub-Types

Ice and Lava are rare elemental subtypes that stack on top of a tier and a variant. They do **not** affect player ships. Instead, they interact dynamically with **Hot Lasers** and **Cold Lasers** (upgrades available on Scouts and Laser Frigates).

*Elemental asteroids begin appearing in Round 5. Non-laser ships deal standard damage with no special interactions.*

### ❄️ Ice Asteroids
Visually distinguished by a pale blue color and frosted surface cracks.

| Laser Type | Outcome | Name | Mechanic Description |
|------------|---------|------|----------------------|
| **Hot Laser** | Clean Clear | **The Melt** | Intense heat vaporizes the ice instantly. The asteroid takes normal tier damage and experiences standard splitting, but **no elemental debris or special chains occur**. The cleanest, most resource-efficient way to clear Ice. |
| **Cold Laser** | AoE Chain | **The Shatter** | Extreme cold instantly freezes and fractures the crystal structure. The target takes normal tier reduction, then releases a shrapnel burst hitting **all asteroids within 2 tiles for 1 tier of damage**. Shrapnel hits do not chain or trigger secondary shatters. |
| **Neutral Shot** | Standard | — | Regular 1-tier reduction with no special properties. |

### 🌋 Lava Asteroids
Visually distinguished by a glowing orange-red molten crust and flowing surface cracks.

| Laser Type | Outcome | Name | Mechanic Description |
|------------|---------|------|----------------------|
| **Cold Laser** | Type Conversion | **The Solidify** | The cold beam cools the molten exterior, forming a solid basalt shell. **The shot is consumed strictly on conversion (dealing 0 damage)**, and the asteroid turns into a standard neutral rock of the same tier. This neutral rock is now fully vulnerable to Missile Cruiser splash and Drones. |
| **Hot Laser** | AoE Chain | **The Overload** | Injecting thermal energy into a pressurized magma core triggers an explosion. The primary target suffers standard tier reduction, then explodes, **dealing 1 tier of damage to all asteroids within the explosion radius**. The explosion does not chain. |
| **Neutral Shot** | Standard | — | Regular 1-tier reduction with no special properties. |

### Overload Blast Radius by Tier
The explosion size scales with the amount of volcanic fuel stored in the asteroid:

| Tier | Name | Blast Radius |
|------|------|--------------|
| **1 / 2** | Pebble / Boulder | 2.0 tiles |
| **3** | Meteor | 2.5 tiles |
| **4** | Giant | 3.0 tiles |
| **5** | Planet Chunk | 3.5 tiles |

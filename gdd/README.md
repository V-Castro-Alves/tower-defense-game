# Space Defenders — Game Design Document Index

Welcome to the **Space Defenders** Game Design Document (GDD). To keep our documentation clean, maintainable, and modular, the GDD is split into separate specialized files. This allows us to update specific gameplay systems (like adding new ship types or updating asteroid variants) without bloating a single file or causing git merge conflicts.

Below is the directory map of the modular GDD:

Welcome to **Space Defenders**, a premium, tactical tower defense game built from the ground up in **Godot 4** using **GDScript**. 

In Space Defenders, you deploy high-tech defense spaceships to protect a vital deep-space station from cascading rounds of incoming asteroids. The game features a unique, physics-themed **asteroid deconstruction splitting system** where an asteroid's size *is* its health. Shooting larger asteroids splits them into smaller, faster-moving chunks, initiating chaotic and satisfying chain reactions that require tactical planning to survive.

---

## 🌌 Core Features

- **Size-as-HP Splitting System**: Large asteroids divide into two smaller debris elements when destroyed, cascading from massive *Planet Chunks* down to swift *Pebbles*.
- **Tactical Fleet Composition**: Deploy 7 distinct spaceship hulls, including focused laser beam ships, long-range heavy artillery, spatial drone swarms, cone-based kinetic blasters, and gravity wells.
- **Armor & Visual Counter-Plays**: Overcome complex asteroid variants like *Blinding Tails* that disrupt ship sensors, *Hard Crusts* that resist light fire, *Magnetic Cores* that regenerate, and *Ring Belts* that block splash damage.
- **Thermal Elemental Mechanics**: Upgrade your laser fleet to fire specialized *Hot* or *Cold* lasers to trigger chemical chain reactions in elements like *Ice* and *Lava* asteroids, melting, solidifying, or exploding clusters in a chain reaction.
- **Test-Driven Design**: The entire game is built using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) model, fully verified by a comprehensive **Godot Unit Test (GUT)** plan.

## 📖 Design Specification Index

We have broken down our comprehensive v0.5 Game Design Document (GDD) into modular chapters. This makes the documentation highly maintainable, preventing merge conflicts and keeping updates clean:

1. **[01. Game Overview](gdd/01_game_overview.md)**: Conceptual pitch, win/loss rules, and player loop.
2. **[02. Core Mechanics](gdd/02_core_mechanics.md)**: Lives parameters, transaction systems, and manual round triggers.
3. **[03. Asteroids & Threat Registry](gdd/03_asteroids.md)**: Splitting physics, HP tiers, variants (Blinding/Crust/Regen/Rings), and elementals (Ice/Lava) reactions.
4. **[04. Spaceships & Towers](gdd/04_spaceships.md)**: Tower registries, placement, repositioning costs, targeting systems, and advanced supports.
5. **[05. Map Design](gdd/05_map.md)**: Coordinates, grid definitions, tile flags, and choke points.
6. **[06. Round System](gdd/06_round_system.md)**: Round-by-round composition configs (Rounds 1-10) and pacing rules.
7. **[07. UI & Input](gdd/07_ui_input.md)**: Head-up display layout, ghost previews, ship controls, and speed settings.
8. **[08. Technical Architecture](gdd/08_technical_architecture.md)**: Singletons, event maps, signal listeners, and Resource GDScript definitions.
9. **[09. TDD Test Plan](gdd/09_tdd_test_plan.md)**: Comprehensive spec guidelines for GUT test coverage.
10. **[10. Roadmap & Questions](gdd/10_roadmap_and_questions.md)**: Chronological project stages, current TBD parameters, and future roadmap.

## 🧪 Testing with GUT (Godot Unit Test)

This project relies on the **GUT plugin** to run unit and integration tests.

### Running Tests in the Editor
1. In the Godot Editor, locate the **GUT tab** in the bottom panel (or activate the GUT plugin under *Project Settings -> Plugins* if not already enabled).
2. Configure the directory paths:
   - **Unit Tests Directory**: `res://tests/unit/`
   - **Integration Tests Directory**: `res://tests/integration/`
3. Click **Run All** in the GUT panel to execute the entire test suite.

### Running Tests from the Command Line
To execute tests via CLI (perfect for automation or CI pipelines), run the following command from your terminal:

```bash
# General Command
godot --path . -s res://addons/gut/gut_cmdline.gd

# Command to run specific test groups
godot --path . -s res://addons/gut/gut_cmdline.gd -gdir=res://tests/unit/
```
*(Ensure `godot` is added to your environment variables, or replace it with the absolute path to your Godot executable).*
